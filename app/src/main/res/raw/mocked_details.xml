        <description>With elegantly simple gameplay, Ticket to Ride can be learned in under 15 minutes, while providing players with intense strategic and tactical decisions every turn. Players collect cards of various types of train cars they then use to claim railway routes in North America. The longer the routes, the more points they earn. Additional points come to those who fulfill Destination Tickets &amp;ndash; goal cards that connect distant cities; and to the player who builds the longest continuous route.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;quot;The rules are simple enough to write on a train ticket &amp;ndash; each turn you either draw more cards, claim a route, or get additional Destination Tickets,&amp;quot; says Ticket to Ride author, Alan R. Moon. &amp;quot;The tension comes from being forced to balance greed &amp;ndash; adding more cards to your hand, and fear &amp;ndash; losing a critical route to a competitor.&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Ticket to Ride continues in the tradition of Days of Wonder's big format board games featuring high-quality illustrations and components including: an oversize board map of North America, 225 custom-molded train cars, 144 illustrated cards, and wooden scoring markers.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Since its introduction and numerous subsequent awards, Ticket to Ride has become the BoardGameGeek epitome of a &amp;quot;gateway game&amp;quot; -- simple enough to be taught in a few minutes, and with enough action and tension to keep new players involved and in the game for the duration.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Part of the Ticket to Ride series.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

            <comment username="100pcBlade" rating="8" value="Scales well 2-5 players, beautifully produced, great introductory game. A bit of luck around the ticket draw but this is fine for this length and weight of game (light-middle). An essential purchase for anyone who plays with casual gamers or for serious gamers who occassionally like something lighter. The Europe map provides some variety and the ticket distribution is an improvement but the rest of the new rules detract from the game. The passenger rules in Marklin are excellent but make the game that little bit too long and the board is a bit too biased to completing tickets. I probably prefer the base game particularly now the 1910 cards have been released" />

130929  After TtR Marklin I really do respect the orignal a lot.  With the 1910 expansion its a great game it can be played tight and nasty (using the original deck after you&apos;ve developed a knowledge of the ticket cards) or with all the cards in play you can just play fun and loose.  Just an absolutely great gateway and more game.

120910 After playing TtR europe, I&apos;ve come away with a newfound respect for the elegance of this game.  I think it shines when played tight and nasty.  Which unfortunately is not the way my girlfriend prefers to play.

100102 may be a bit light for my taste, but one of the first one to bring out if its with non-gamers." />

            <comment username="aaj94" rating="5" value="Ticket to Ride is a modern-day classic, deserves to be in most collections as a good intro set-collection game.

Ticket to Ride is a classic along the level of Catan, and I definitely enjoy its simplicity and elegance. It&apos;s a very simple mechanic, but the player competition and the unknown aspect of the cards makes it different every time.

Basically, players are competing to build train routes along different colored tracks throughout the United States. They accomplish this by drawing cards of the correct color, then claiming routes by placing their own trains along the route.

You earn points by completing Tickets (preset routes that you draw from the ticket deck), placing routes, and winning the longest connected route, which is similar to the Longest Road in Settlers of Catan.

Overall, I enjoy Ticket to Ride, but I don&apos;t feel the need to have it in my collection. It&apos;s definitely worth some plays even if you&apos;re a hardcore gamer, and the rules can be gone over in about fifteen minutes. This makes Ticket to Ride a great choice for new or reluctant gamers, since it&apos;s really easy to have a fun time with it. Personally, I prefer introducing people with [thing=123540][/thing] instead." />

            <comment username="Aberrix" rating="7" value="I really enjoy this game! it&apos;s a pretty light weight game which really fits the bill some times, everyone who plays it really seems to enjoy it. It&apos;s a rummy-type game where you collect cards of the same colors and then claiming routes. The small cards while annoying at first really don&apos;t seem to bother me once the game gets going but I still wish they could&apos;ve just included full sized cards instead of charging you $20 for the 1910 expansion which is basically just full sized cards... None the less, I still really enjoy this game." />

            <comment username="abrocker" rating="7" value="As everyone says, it is a great gateway game.  Good production value and fun game play.  Less strategy then I prefer though.
Bumping this to an 8.  Played it with my wife and a couple of bots.  Had a blast. :)" />
            <comment username="absenthero" rating="8" value="Great blend of strategy and card draw chance. Easy for kids and families to learn and play. There are several versions and expansions of this (now) classic board game, so I would suggest starting with the original (United States) map version.

Would definitely recommend to novice and experienced gamers alike!" />
            <comment username="Abysmul" rating="8" value="Must have for any collection. What more needs said, it&apos;s a classic in the truest since of the word." />
            <comment username="aCardboardBox" rating="7" value="Super passive aggressive game of building around people.  This is a very quiet game where people curse at other&apos;s success.  It&apos;s streamlined enough to where the game is still enjoyable though." />
            <comment username="Accession" rating="9" value="Highly recommended for anyone new to the hobby. Suitable choice as a gateway game. Mechanics are simple yet elegant. Rules are easy to learn." />
            <comment username="Accursed Pilgrim" rating="7" value="Solid strategy game.  Definitely a must have family title.

My 8 year old daughter caught on almost  immediately in her first play and even  developed deeper strategy in that first game to stab me repeatedly in the back.  Great times!" />

            <comment username="aceraxon" rating="7" value="Beautiful game, great fun, can be easy going or fierce.  This game can really turn cutthroat in a heart-beat too.  An awesome game that I&apos;m glad to have in my collection.  Not as balanced as the Europe version, but a superb gateway game." />

        <description>The game is created from the movie &amp;quot;The Third Man&amp;quot;. The story takes place in Vienna after WWII.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In the movie there are famous scenes about finding the culprit in the sewer system. One player is the culprit, the others are the pursuers.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game has two phases. Phase 1 consists of building the sewerage system with tiles. The players have to draw the sewerage labyrinth on paper.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In phase 2 the culprit has to reach the sewer exit on the other side of the board.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The other players have to find him in the labyrinth before he reaches the exit. The culprit makes his moves by writing them down on paper while  the pursuers  move their pieces on the board.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
